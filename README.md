# TributaryImpact

### What is this repository for? ###

The Tributary Impact tool finds intersections in a stream network and calculates the likelyhood of the tributary forming a fan where it intersects the mainstem, based on the findings in *Tributary Connectivity, Confluence Aggradation and Network Biodiversity* by Stephen P. Rice (2017).

### What inputs do I need to run this tool? ###

You need a stream network and a DEM. They must both use the same projection.
